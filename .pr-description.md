# chore(ci): add TypeScript diagnostics workflow and ignore backups for CodeQL

## Overview
This PR addresses CodeQL parse errors by excluding backup directories and adding TypeScript diagnostics to CI to help identify and fix source file issues.

## Problem
The CodeQL workflow (ref: f4a022a66369cbfacbf7746a6e818e3319667a0d) is failing due to parse errors in backup directories and potentially some source files.

## Solution
This PR implements two key changes:

### 1. Updated `.codeqlignore`
Added exclusions for backup directories that contain invalid/non-source files:
- `backup_2025-09-16_02-21-22/**` - Specific backup snapshot
- `backup_*/**` - All backup directories matching this pattern

This prevents CodeQL from attempting to parse files in these directories, which were causing SARIF processing failures.

### 2. Created `.github/workflows/tsc-diagnostics.yml`
New GitHub Actions workflow that:
- Runs on push to main and on pull requests
- Executes TypeScript compiler in diagnostic mode (`npx tsc --noEmit`)
- Surfaces parsing and type errors as job output and annotations
- Helps centralize error collection for easier debugging

## Benefits
- **Unblocks CodeQL**: Removing backup directories from scanning allows CodeQL to complete successfully
- **Centralizes diagnostics**: TypeScript errors are now visible in CI, making it easier to identify and prioritize fixes
- **Prevents regressions**: Future PRs will run type checking automatically

## Next Steps
After this PR is merged:

1. **Monitor the TypeScript diagnostics workflow** to collect all parsing and type errors
2. **Fix identified source file issues** based on the diagnostic output
3. **Consider removing backup directories** from the repository entirely (they should not be version controlled)
4. **Re-run CodeQL** to verify it completes successfully with clean source files

## Testing
- ✅ Verified `.codeqlignore` syntax
- ✅ Verified workflow YAML syntax
- ✅ Both files follow existing patterns in the repository
