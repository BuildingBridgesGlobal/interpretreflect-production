# Process 35-Page Investor Deck (Chunked)

## How To Share
- Option A: share a view-only Google Docs link set to `Anyone with the link: Viewer`.
- Option B: paste the content here in chunks of ~5–7 pages until all 35 pages are covered.
- If there are embedded tables/images, include a brief description (e.g., “Table: pricing tiers,” “Image: product architecture diagram”).

## Chunking Guidelines
- Start each paste with: `CHUNK <n> (pages X–Y)` and include the document section titles as they appear.
- Preserve headings, subheadings, bullets, and numbered lists.
- For tables, paste as text rows (Header: values). For images, add a 1–2 line caption.
- If a chunk cuts mid-section, include the trailing sentence and note “continues in next chunk.”

## Processing Flow
1. Read each chunk and tag content by theme: Vision, Problem, Solution, Product, Market, Competition, GTM, Traction, Financials, Risks, Roadmap.
2. Extract goals, assumptions, KPIs, milestones, and technical requirements.
3. Identify gaps or contradictions and list clarifying questions (kept concise and actionable).
4. Maintain a running synthesis that updates after each chunk; after all chunks, produce final consolidated outputs.

## Deliverables
- Executive summary (1 page) with narrative, traction, and ask.
- Condensed investor deck (12–15 slides) with storyline, metrics, and visuals guidance.
- Product roadmap by phases (Pre-product → Alpha → Beta → v1) with milestones/KPIs.
- Engineering backlog: epics with clear outcomes and acceptance criteria.
- Risks & assumptions table with mitigations.
- Investor FAQ/Q&A prep with crisp, defensible answers.

## Turnaround
- Provide interim notes after each 2–3 chunks; deliver full first-pass synthesis once all chunks are received.
- Iteration round after your review to refine narrative and prioritization.

## Privacy & Handling
- Treat all content as confidential; avoid exposing sensitive data in outputs beyond what’s necessary.
- No repository or system changes until you approve outputs.

## Next Step
- Confirm this plan, then start sending `CHUNK 1 (pages 1–5/7)` using the format above, or grant view access on the Google Doc.
