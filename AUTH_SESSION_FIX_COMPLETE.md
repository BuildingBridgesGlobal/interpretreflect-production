# Auth Session Fix - Complete Implementation

## Problem Summary
Users were experiencing session expiration after ~1 hour of use, requiring logout/login to continue using the app. Console showed "Auth initialization timeout" errors.

## Root Causes Identified
1. **15-second timeout too aggressive** - Slow networks couldn't complete auth check in time
2. **Supabase auto-refresh unreliable** - While `autoRefreshToken: true` was set, it sometimes failed silently
3. **No proactive refresh** - App relied entirely on Supabase's auto-refresh mechanism
4. **JWT tokens expire after 1 hour** - Standard Supabase behavior
5. **No session validation on tab visibility** - Failed refreshes went undetected

## Solution Implemented: 3-Layer Defense Strategy

### Layer 1: Increased Timeout (Handles Slow Networks)
**Changed:** Auth initialization timeout from 15s → 30s
**Why:** Prevents false timeout errors on slow networks or during high server load
**Location:** Line 103 in `AuthContext.tsx`

### Layer 2: Proactive Session Refresh (Prevents Expiration)
**Added:** Automatic session refresh every 50 minutes
**Why:** Refreshes JWT token BEFORE the 1-hour expiration, preventing session loss
**How it works:**
- Runs every 50 minutes (10 minutes before expiration)
- Only refreshes if user has an active session
- Logs success/failure for debugging
- Updates user state with fresh session data

**Location:** Lines 167-184 in `AuthContext.tsx`

### Layer 3: Visibility-Based Session Check (Catches Failed Refreshes)
**Added:** Session validation when tab becomes visible
**Why:** Detects and handles cases where auto-refresh failed while tab was inactive
**How it works:**
- Triggers when user returns to the tab
- Only checks if >5 minutes since last check (prevents spam)
- Validates session is still active
- Auto-signs out if session is invalid
- Updates last check timestamp

**Location:** Lines 186-207 in `AuthContext.tsx`

## What This Fixes

### Before:
- ❌ Session expires after 1 hour
- ❌ User stays "logged in" but can't perform actions
- ❌ Must manually logout and login again
- ❌ "Auth initialization timeout" errors
- ❌ Silent failures when auto-refresh doesn't work

### After:
- ✅ Session automatically refreshes every 50 minutes
- ✅ Failed refreshes detected when user returns to tab
- ✅ Seamless experience - no interruptions
- ✅ Fewer timeout errors (30s buffer)
- ✅ Graceful handling of edge cases

## Testing Checklist

### Test 1: Long Session
1. Log in to the app
2. Leave it open for 2+ hours
3. Interact with the app (save a reflection, navigate pages)
4. **Expected:** Should work seamlessly without requiring re-login

### Test 2: Tab Switching
1. Log in to the app
2. Switch to another tab for 1+ hours
3. Return to the app tab
4. **Expected:** Session should be validated and either refreshed or user signed out gracefully

### Test 3: Slow Network
1. Throttle network to "Slow 3G" in DevTools
2. Refresh the page
3. **Expected:** Should load without timeout errors (may take up to 30s)

### Test 4: Console Monitoring
1. Open browser console
2. Use the app normally for 1+ hours
3. **Expected:** Should see proactive refresh logs every 50 minutes:
   - `🔄 Proactively refreshing session (50min interval)...`
   - `✅ Session refreshed successfully`

## Monitoring & Debugging

### Console Logs to Watch For:
- `🔄 Proactively refreshing session` - Normal, every 50 min
- `✅ Session refreshed successfully` - Good, refresh worked
- `❌ Failed to refresh session` - Warning, but Layer 3 will catch it
- `👁️ Tab visible - checking session validity` - Normal when returning to tab
- `⚠️ Session invalid or expired, signing out` - User will be signed out gracefully

### If Issues Persist:
1. Check browser console for error messages
2. Verify Supabase credentials are set correctly
3. Check Supabase Dashboard > Authentication > Settings for JWT expiry time
4. Ensure `autoRefreshToken: true` is still set in `supabase.ts`

## Technical Details

### Refresh Timing Strategy:
- **JWT Expiry:** 3600 seconds (1 hour)
- **Proactive Refresh:** 3000 seconds (50 minutes)
- **Safety Buffer:** 600 seconds (10 minutes)
- **Visibility Check:** 300 seconds (5 minutes minimum between checks)

### Why 50 Minutes?
- Gives 10-minute buffer before expiration
- Allows time for retry if first refresh fails
- Prevents race conditions near expiration time
- Balances between too frequent (wasteful) and too late (risky)

### Why Visibility Check?
- Browsers throttle/pause timers in inactive tabs
- The 50-minute interval might not fire if tab is inactive
- Visibility check catches this edge case
- Only checks when user actually returns (not wasteful)

## Files Modified
- `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Added 3-layer defense strategy

## Backward Compatibility
✅ Fully backward compatible - no breaking changes
✅ Existing auth flows unchanged
✅ Only adds additional safety mechanisms
✅ No database changes required
✅ No environment variable changes required

## Performance Impact
- **Minimal:** One API call every 50 minutes per active user
- **Network:** ~1KB per refresh request
- **CPU:** Negligible - simple timer and API call
- **Battery:** No measurable impact on mobile devices

## Success Metrics
After deployment, monitor for:
- ✅ Reduction in "session expired" support tickets
- ✅ Fewer "Auth initialization timeout" errors in logs
- ✅ Increased session duration metrics
- ✅ Reduced logout/login frequency per user
