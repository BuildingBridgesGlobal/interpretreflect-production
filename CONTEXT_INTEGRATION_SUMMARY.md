# Context-Specific Questions Integration Summary

## ✅ Complete Integration Achieved

All context-specific questions now fully integrate with Supabase and feed into Growth Insights with Elya AI analysis capabilities.

## What's Been Implemented

### 1. Context Reflection Service (`contextReflectionService.ts`)
A comprehensive service that:
- **Saves all context-specific reflections to Supabase** with automatic analysis
- **Identifies context type** (medical, legal, educational, mental health, community)
- **Generates insights** including strengths, challenges, patterns, and recommendations
- **Calculates context-specific metrics** for each domain
- **Prepares data for Elya AI** with personalized learning paths

### 2. Enhanced Context Components

#### Context-Specific Framework (`ContextSpecificFramework.tsx`)
- Now uses the enhanced service for saving
- Automatically generates insights when saving reflections
- Tracks specialized questions for 5 different contexts

#### Growth Insights Context (`GrowthInsightsContext.tsx`)
- Displays comprehensive context-specific analytics
- Shows distribution across different interpreting contexts
- Visualizes performance metrics for each context
- Provides top challenges and skills analysis
- Includes Elya AI recommendations

## Elya AI Integration Features

### Data Prepared for Elya
1. **Context Distribution**: Shows specialization areas
2. **Skill Profile**: Identifies strongest competencies
3. **Challenge Analysis**: Highlights areas for improvement
4. **Learning Path Suggestions**: Recommends certifications and training
5. **Personalized Recommendations**: Tailored growth strategies

### Example Elya Recommendations
Based on reflection patterns, Elya might suggest:
- "Advanced Medical Interpreting Certification" for frequent medical contexts

## Database Schema Updates

### reflections table
- Now includes `metadata.context_type`
- Stores `metadata.insights` with analysis
- Tracks `metadata.framework_used`

### New: context_metrics table
```sql
CREATE TABLE context_metrics (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  context_type TEXT NOT NULL,
  metrics JSONB NOT NULL,
  last_updated TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

## How to Use

### For Users
1. Complete context-specific reflections through the UI
2. View insights in Growth Insights dashboard
3. Click "Analyze with Elya" for AI-powered recommendations
4. Track progress in specific context areas

### For Developers
```typescript
// Import the service
import { 
  saveContextReflection,
  getContextStatistics,
  prepareContextDataForElya 
} from './services/contextReflectionService';

// Save a context reflection
const result = await saveContextReflection(userId, 'pearls', answers);

// Get statistics
const stats = await getContextStatistics(userId, 'month');

// Prepare for Elya
const elyaData = await prepareContextDataForElya(userId, '90days');
```
