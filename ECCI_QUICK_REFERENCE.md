## 🚫 Critical Updates

### Date Changes
- ❌ "Active December 1, 2025"
- ✅ "Now Active" or "Available Now"

### CTA Standardization
- ❌ "Begin Performance Analysis"
- ✅ "Start Your Performance Assessment"

### Year References
- ❌ "Recent national studies (2025)"
- ✅ "National studies from 2024-2025"

---

## 💡 Tone Guidelines

### ✅ DO Use:
- Benefit-focused language
- Simple explanations + credibility markers
- Active voice ("Get insights" not "Insights are provided")
- Direct address ("your brain" not "the brain")
- Practical language ("practical strategies" not "strategic interventions")

### ❌ DON'T Use:
- Academic jargon without context
- Passive voice
- Overly technical terms
- Process descriptions instead of benefits
- Multiple technical terms in one sentence

---

## 🎓 Credibility Markers (Always Include)

When simplifying language, always pair with a credibility marker:

**Pattern:** [Simple explanation] + [Credibility marker]

**Examples:**
- "Research-backed methods" + "16 frameworks"
- "Science-backed assessments" + "neuroscience-based"
- "Practical strategies" + "built on the ECCI™ framework"
- "Measure how your brain handles" + "neuroscience research"

---

## 📝 Performance Optimization Protocol (Simplified)

**Step 1:** "Take a 15-minute assessment. Get your personalized performance profile with specific metrics."

**Step 2:** "Log your daily performance: baseline checks, post-assignment reflections, and capacity tracking—all included in your platform access."

**Step 3:** "Purchase CEU bundles to certify your professional development while building sustainable practice habits."

### Use Technical Language:
- Academic papers
- Grant applications
- Conference presentations
- Research documentation

### Use Accessible Language:
- Website copy
- Marketing materials
- User onboarding
- Sales presentations
- Email campaigns
- Social media

## 🎨 Writing Examples

### ❌ Before (Too Technical)
"The ECCI™ Model (Emotional & Cultural Competencies for Interpreters): 16 integrated frameworks analyzing cognitive load, cultural processing, and performance neuroplasticity through multimodal information processing optimization."

### ✅ After (Accessible + Credible)
"Our proprietary ECCI™ Framework (Emotional & Cultural Competencies for Interpreters) uses 16 research-backed methods to measure how your brain handles cognitive load, cultural processing, and performance growth."

---

### ❌ Before (Too Vague)
"Catalyst helps you perform better."

### ✅ After (Clear + Specific)
"Catalyst analyzes your cognitive patterns and suggests practical strategies to optimize your capacity. Built on the ECCI™ framework. Your data is 100% private."

---

### ❌ Before (Too Complex)
"24/7 access to personalized insights and recommendations. Catalyst accelerates your professional growth by analyzing cognitive load patterns and optimizing capacity through algorithmic pattern recognition."

### ✅ After (Simple + Clear)

## 🚀 Implementation Priority

Apply changes in this order:

1. **Critical Dates** - Fix "December 1, 2025" everywhere
2. **CTAs** - Standardize button text
3. **Hero Section** - Update subheadline
4. **Card Descriptions** - Simplify ECCI language
5. **Statistics** - Update year references
6. **Footer** - Ensure RID approval is prominent

---

## 💭 Remember

**The Goal:** Maintain the ECCI Framework as your competitive advantage while making it accessible to exhausted interpreters seeking solutions.

**The Formula:** Simple explanation + Credibility marker = Trust without overwhelm

**The Test:** Would a tired interpreter understand this immediately? If no, simplify. If yes but credibility is lost, add a credibility marker.

---

## 📞 Need Help?

Ask yourself:
1. **Is this benefit-focused?** (What it does for them)
2. **Is it simple?** (No unnecessary jargon)
3. **Is it credible?** (Research-backed language present)
4. **Would I understand this at 9pm after a hard day?**

If the answer to all four is YES, you're good to go! ✅
