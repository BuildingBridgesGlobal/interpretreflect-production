# Enterprise Dashboard MVP - Phase 2 Complete! 🎉

## What We Built Today

### Phase 1: Database Foundation ✅
Created 5 database tables with full security:
1. `organizations` - Company information
2. `organization_members` - Links interpreters to companies
3. `organization_invitations` - Invitation system
4. `organization_metrics_cache` - Aggregate data storage
5. `organization_alerts` - Notifications and weekly digest

### Phase 2: MVP Dashboard UI ✅
Built a functional enterprise dashboard with:
1. **Hook** - `useOrganizationRole` to detect org admins
2. **Service** - `organizationService` to fetch data
3. **Dashboard Page** - `/enterprise` route with metrics
4. **Navigation** - "Team Dashboard" tab (only visible to admins)

## Features Implemented

### Dashboard Displays:
- ✅ **Team Size Card** - Total members + active count
- ✅ **Average Burnout Risk** - 0-100% with high-risk count
- ✅ **Average Confidence** - 0-100% with low-confidence count
- ✅ **Weekly Activity** - Reflections + stress resets combined
- ✅ **Recent Alerts** - Color-coded by severity with action items
- ✅ **Privacy Protection** - Data hidden if <5 members

### Security & Privacy:
- ✅ **Aggregate Only** - No individual data shown
- ✅ **Minimum Team Size** - 5 members required
- ✅ **RLS Policies** - Company admins can only see their data
- ✅ **Consent Tracking** - Built into database schema
- ✅ **Privacy Notice** - Displayed on dashboard

## How It Works

### For You (Admin):
1. You manually create organizations in Supabase
2. You add company admins as organization members with role='admin'
3. Company admins log in and see "Team Dashboard" tab
4. They click it and see their team's aggregate metrics

### For Company Admins:
1. Log in to InterpretReflect
2. See "Team Dashboard" tab in navigation
3. Click to view team wellness metrics
4. See aggregate data (if 5+ members)
5. View alerts and suggested actions

## Files Created

### Database:
- `supabase/migrations/step1_create_organizations_table.sql`
- `supabase/migrations/step2_create_organization_members_table.sql`
- `supabase/migrations/step3_create_organization_invitations_table.sql`
- `supabase/migrations/step4_create_organization_metrics_cache_table.sql`
- `supabase/migrations/step5_create_organization_alerts_table.sql`
- `supabase/migrations/step6_add_missing_organization_policies.sql`

### Frontend:
- `src/hooks/useOrganizationRole.ts` - Detects if user is org admin
- `src/services/organizationService.ts` - API calls for org data
- `src/pages/EnterpriseDashboard.tsx` - Main dashboard component

### Updated:
- `src/App.tsx` - Added `/enterprise` route
- `src/components/layout/NavigationTabs.tsx` - Added conditional "Team Dashboard" tab

## What's Missing (Future Enhancements)

### Not Yet Implemented:
- ❌ Metrics aggregation job (daily background task)
- ❌ Alert generation logic
- ❌ Charts/graphs (burnout trend over time)
- ❌ Date range filters
- ❌ Data export (CSV/PDF)
- ❌ Weekly email digest
- ❌ Invitation system UI
- ❌ Member management UI
- ❌ Your admin panel to create orgs

## Next Steps

### To Make It Functional:

**Step 1: Create Test Organization**
```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor
INSERT INTO organizations (name, primary_contact_email, primary_contact_name)
VALUES ('Test Company', 'admin@testcompany.com', 'Test Admin')
RETURNING id;
```

**Step 2: Add Yourself as Admin**
```sql
-- Replace YOUR_USER_ID with your actual user ID
-- Replace ORG_ID with the ID from step 1
INSERT INTO organization_members (organization_id, user_id, role, consent_given, consent_date, is_active)
VALUES ('ORG_ID', 'YOUR_USER_ID', 'admin', true, NOW(), true);
```

**Step 3: Add Test Metrics**
```sql
-- Replace ORG_ID with your organization ID
INSERT INTO organization_metrics_cache (
  organization_id, 
  date, 
  total_members, 
  active_members,
  avg_burnout_score,
  avg_confidence_level,
  high_burnout_count,
  low_confidence_count,
  total_reflections,
  total_stress_resets
) VALUES (
  'ORG_ID',
  CURRENT_DATE,
  10,  -- total members
  8,   -- active members
  45.5,  -- avg burnout (0-100)
  72.3,  -- avg confidence (0-100)
  2,   -- high burnout count
  1,   -- low confidence count
  25,  -- reflections
  15   -- stress resets
);
```

**Step 4: Add Test Alert**
```sql
-- Replace ORG_ID with your organization ID
INSERT INTO organization_alerts (
  organization_id,
  alert_type,
  severity,
  title,
  message,
  action_items
) VALUES (
  'ORG_ID',
  'high_burnout',
  'warning',
  'Elevated Burnout Levels Detected',
  '20% of your team is showing burnout risk above 70%. Consider wellness check-ins.',
  ARRAY['Schedule team wellness meeting', 'Review workload distribution', 'Offer additional support resources']
);
```

**Step 5: Test the Dashboard**
1. Log in to InterpretReflect
2. You should see "Team Dashboard" tab
3. Click it to view the dashboard
4. You should see the test metrics and alert

### Future Development Priorities:

**Phase 3: Metrics Aggregation (Week 3)**
- Build daily job to calculate aggregate metrics
- Pull data from burnout assessments, reflections, etc.
- Store in metrics_cache table
- Generate alerts based on thresholds

**Phase 4: Charts & Visualization (Week 4)**
- Add burnout trend line chart
- Add confidence trend line chart
- Add activity heatmap
- Add date range selector

**Phase 5: Admin Tools (Week 5)**
- Your admin panel to create organizations
- Invitation system for adding interpreters
- Member management interface
- Weekly email digest setup

## Testing Checklist
