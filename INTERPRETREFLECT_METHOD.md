## Core Philosophy

**Supportive, Not Prescriptive**
- Mentor-like guidance that feels collaborative
- Warm, accessible language
- Respects interpreter expertise while offering structure
- Encourages self-discovery over rigid rules

**Interdisciplinary Foundation**
Drawing from:
- **Reflective Practice** (Schön, Kolb)
- **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)** - Thought patterns and reframing
- **Neuroscience** - Somatic experiencing, stress discharge, polyvagal theory
- **Emotional Intelligence** - Self-awareness, regulation, differentiation
- **Communication Theory** - Interaction patterns, meaning-making
- **Acting Methods** - Presence, embodiment, role awareness
- **Interpreting Theory** - Role-space, demand-control schema
- **Sociology & Human Connection** - Relationships, power dynamics, cultural awareness

## The Universal Flow Pattern

All InterpretReflect tools follow a consistent, teachable sequence that interpreters can internalize and use anywhere:

### **The 8-Phase Cycle**

1. **IMMEDIATE** - What's happening right NOW?
2. **CONTEXT** - What's the situation?
3. **PERFORMANCE** - How am I doing/How did I do?
4. **ADAPTATION** - What strategies am I using/did I use?
5. **LEARNING** - What knowledge am I gaining/did I gain?
6. **EMOTIONAL** - How is this affecting me emotionally?
7. **PHYSICAL** - What's happening in my body?
8. **INTEGRATION** - How do I move forward?

**Simplified:** React → Reflect → Analyze → Learn → Process → Release → Integrate

3. **Energy & Focus** - What's my energy level?
4. **Professional Boundaries** - Am I maintaining boundaries?
5. **Communication Flow** - How's the interaction going?
6. **Immediate Adjustments** - What do I need to do right now?

---

### **Post-Assignment Debrief** (After)
**Purpose:** Processing, learning, and emotional/physical discharge

**Flow:**
1. **Opening Context** (IMMEDIATE)
   - How are you feeling right now?
   - What stands out most?
   - What do you need for well-being?

2. **Assignment Review** (CONTEXT)

   - Who was involved?
   - What were the initial challenges?

3. **Performance Assessment** (PERFORMANCE)
   - What went well?
   - What was challenging?
   - How accurate were you?

4. **Adaptations & Growth** (ADAPTATION)

- **Metacognitive awareness** improves over time

### **Emotional Benefits**
- **Validates experience** through structured reflection
- **Normalizes challenges** by asking about them systematically
- **Builds resilience** through regular processing
- **Prevents burnout** through discharge and integration

### **Professional Benefits**
- **Skill development** through deliberate reflection
- **Pattern recognition** across assignments
- **Evidence of growth** through tracked reflections
- **Transferable methodology** for teaching others

### **Neurological Benefits**
- **Stress discharge** through somatic practices
