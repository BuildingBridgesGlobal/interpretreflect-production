# Payment Flow Security Fix

## Problem Fixed
Users could sign up, reach the payment page, close the Stripe checkout window, and then log in for free. This was a critical security vulnerability allowing unauthorized access to the platform.

## Root Cause
The account was being created **before** payment verification in [SeamlessSignup.tsx:102-128](src/pages/SeamlessSignup.tsx#L102-L128). This meant users had valid credentials even if they never completed payment.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Payment-First Account Creation
**File**: [src/pages/SeamlessSignup.tsx](src/pages/SeamlessSignup.tsx#L95-L177)

- **REMOVED**: Premature account creation in the PaymentForm component
- **ADDED**: Account credentials are now stored in localStorage temporarily
- **ADDED**: Signup metadata is passed to Stripe checkout session
- Account creation now happens **only after successful payment** via webhook

### 2. Webhook-Based Account Creation
**File**: [supabase/functions/stripe-webhook/index.ts](supabase/functions/stripe-webhook/index.ts#L93-L137)

- **ADDED**: New account creation logic in `checkout.session.completed` event
- When `is_new_signup` is true in metadata, the webhook:
  1. Creates the user account using Supabase Admin Auth
  2. Auto-confirms their email (since they paid)
  3. Updates their profile with subscription info
  4. Sets up their subscription record

### 3. Enhanced Access Control
**File**: [src/hooks/useSubscription.ts](src/hooks/useSubscription.ts#L22-L96)

The subscription verification now checks three access levels:
1. **Admin accounts** - Full access (is_admin = true)
2. **Active trials** - Access during valid trial period
3. **Paid subscriptions** - Active or past_due status

### 4. Existing Protection Layer
**File**: [src/components/SubscriptionGate.tsx](src/components/SubscriptionGate.tsx)

This component already wraps all authenticated routes and blocks users without valid subscriptions from accessing the platform.

## How It Works Now

### New User Signup Flow:
1. User fills out signup form (email, password, name)
2. User selects a plan
3. User clicks "Continue to Payment"
4. **NO ACCOUNT CREATED YET** - credentials stored in localStorage
5. User redirected to Stripe checkout
6. User completes payment in Stripe
7. Stripe sends webhook to backend
8. **NOW** the webhook creates the user account with confirmed email
9. User can now sign in with full access

### Existing User Flow:
- Users with active subscriptions: ✅ Access granted
- Users with active trials: ✅ Access granted
- Admin users: ✅ Access granted
- Users without payment: ❌ Blocked by SubscriptionGate

## Testing Instructions

### Test 1: Verify Free Access is Blocked
1. Go to `/signup`
2. Fill out the signup form
3. Select a plan
4. Click "Continue to Payment"
5. When Stripe checkout opens, **close the window**
6. Try to sign in with the credentials you entered
7. **Expected**: Login should fail (account doesn't exist yet)

### Test 2: Verify Paid Access Works
1. Go to `/signup`
2. Fill out the signup form
3. Select a plan
4. Complete the Stripe checkout with test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
5. Wait for webhook to process (~5 seconds)
6. Check your email for confirmation
7. Sign in with your credentials
8. **Expected**: Should have full access to the platform

### Test 3: Verify Existing Users Can't Access Without Payment
1. Create a user account manually in Supabase Auth (admin panel)
2. Do NOT add any subscription records
3. Try to sign in with those credentials
4. **Expected**: Should be blocked by SubscriptionGate and redirected to /signup

### Test 4: Verify Trial Users Have Access
1. Sign up for a trial via `/trial-signup` (if enabled)
2. Complete trial signup without payment
3. Sign in
4. **Expected**: Should have access until trial expires

### Test 5: Verify Admin Access
1. Create a user and set `is_admin = true` in profiles table
2. Sign in as that user
3. **Expected**: Should have full access regardless of subscription status

## Security Improvements

✅ **No free access**: Accounts only created after payment
✅ **No orphaned accounts**: Failed payments = no account created
✅ **Webhook verification**: Uses Stripe's secure webhook signature
✅ **Auto-confirmed emails**: Paid users don't need to verify email
✅ **Trial support**: Free trials still work via separate flow
✅ **Admin access**: Admins bypass all payment checks
✅ **Grace period**: Past_due subscriptions get temporary access

## Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Deploy updated frontend code
- [ ] Deploy updated Stripe webhook function
- [ ] Verify webhook is receiving events in Stripe Dashboard
- [ ] Test with Stripe test mode first
- [ ] Verify existing paid users still have access
- [ ] Test new signup flow end-to-end
- [ ] Monitor webhook logs for errors
- [ ] Update Stripe webhook secret in Supabase if needed

## Environment Variables Required

```bash
# Stripe (already configured)
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_xxx
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_xxx

# Supabase (already configured)
SUPABASE_URL=https://xxx.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=xxx
```

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise:
1. Revert [src/pages/SeamlessSignup.tsx](src/pages/SeamlessSignup.tsx) to previous version
2. This will restore pre-payment account creation
3. Keep webhook changes (they're backwards compatible)
4. Old flow will work but security issue will return

## Files Modified

1. ✅ [src/pages/SeamlessSignup.tsx](src/pages/SeamlessSignup.tsx) - Payment-first signup
2. ✅ [supabase/functions/stripe-webhook/index.ts](supabase/functions/stripe-webhook/index.ts) - Webhook account creation
3. ✅ [src/hooks/useSubscription.ts](src/hooks/useSubscription.ts) - Enhanced access control
4. ✅ [src/components/ProtectedRoute.tsx](src/components/ProtectedRoute.tsx) - NEW: Route protection component (optional)

## Notes

- The SubscriptionGate component was already in place and working
- No changes needed to database schema
- Existing paid users are unaffected
- Trial signup flow (`/trial-signup`) remains separate and functional
- Admin users continue to have unrestricted access
