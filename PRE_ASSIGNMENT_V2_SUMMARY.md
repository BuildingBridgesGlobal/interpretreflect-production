## üöÄ Usage

### Access the Component
Navigate to: `http://localhost:5173/pre-assignment-v2`

### User Flow
1. User starts assessment
2. Answers questions one at a time
3. Can navigate back to review/edit
4. Progress auto-saves every 3 questions
5. Completion triggers full save and analysis
6. Results feed into growth insights dashboard

### Integration Points
- Links with Post-Assignment Debrief
- Feeds Growth Insights Dashboard
- Connects to user profile metrics
- Supports team analytics (if enabled)

## üé® Design Rationale

### Why Linear Flow?
- **Reduces cognitive load** - focus on one question at a time
- **Prevents overwhelm** - users don't see all questions at once
- **Improves completion rates** - clear progress indication
- **Better mobile experience** - optimized for small screens

### Why These Colors?
- **Teal/Cyan** - calming, professional, accessible
- **Category colors** - visual memory aids
- **Soft backgrounds** - reduce eye strain
- **High contrast** - accessibility compliance

### Why These Questions?
- **Evidence-based** - grounded in neuroscience research
- **Comprehensive** - covers all aspects of interpreter wellness
- **Progressive** - builds from awareness to action
- **Measurable** - enables growth tracking

## üìä Analytics & Insights

The system tracks:
- Time per question
- Revision patterns
- Completion rates
- Response trends
- Growth trajectories

This data enables:
- Personalized recommendations
- Pattern identification
- Progress visualization
- Predictive wellness alerts

## üîí Privacy & Security

- All data encrypted in transit (HTTPS)
- Row-level security in Supabase
- User-owned data model
- GDPR-compliant data handling
- Optional data sharing controls

## üö¶ Future Enhancements

Potential additions:
- AI-powered response analysis
