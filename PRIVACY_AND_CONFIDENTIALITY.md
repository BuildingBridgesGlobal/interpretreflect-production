## User Guidance for Confidentiality

### **Our Approach:**

**We DON'T:**
- ❌ Show scary warnings that undermine trust
- ❌ Make users feel like the site isn't secure
- ❌ Put privacy notices in the reflection tools themselves

**We DO:**
- ✅ Provide clear privacy information in Settings and documentation
- ✅ Build trust through transparency about our security
- ✅ Let users reflect freely and authentically
- ✅ Educate through onboarding and help resources

### **Best Practices (For Documentation/Help Center):**

**Interpreters should focus on:**
- ✅ Their own experience, skills, and growth
- ✅ Emotional and physical responses
- ✅ Strategies and adaptations they used
- ✅ What they learned and want to improve

**The reflection is about YOU, not your clients:**
- Focus on "How did I feel?" not "What did they say?"
- Focus on "What did I do?" not "What happened to them?"
- Focus on "What can I improve?" not "What was wrong with the situation?"

## Compliance Considerations

### **For Healthcare Interpreting (HIPAA)**
- ⚠️ **Current Status:** Infrastructure is HIPAA-compliant capable
- ⚠️ **Needed:** Business Associate Agreement (BAA) with Supabase
- ⚠️ **User Responsibility:** Avoid including PHI (Protected Health Information)
- ✅ **Recommendation:** Treat as a professional journal, not medical records

### **For Legal Interpreting**
- ✅ **Attorney-Client Privilege:** Users maintain privilege by not including identifying details
- ✅ **Work Product:** Reflections are interpreter's personal professional development
- ✅ **Best Practice:** Focus on interpreter experience, not case substance

### **For Educational/Community Interpreting**
- ✅ **FERPA Compliance:** Don't include student names or identifying information
- ✅ **General Guidance:** Use role descriptions and general contexts

---

## Data Retention & Deletion

### **User Control**
- **Export Data:** Users can download all their data anytime (Settings → Privacy → Export Data)
- **Delete Account:** Permanently removes all user data (Settings → Privacy → Delete Account)
- **Selective Deletion:** Users can delete individual reflections

### **Our Policy**
- **Active Accounts:** Data retained as long as account is active
- **Deleted Accounts:** All data permanently deleted within 30 days
- **Backups:** Deleted data removed from backups within 90 days
- **No Recovery:** Once deleted, data cannot be recovered

---

## For Agencies & Organizations

### **What We Can Provide:**
✅ **Security Documentation** - SOC 2 reports, security whitepaper
✅ **Data Processing Agreement** - Standard DPA available
✅ **Custom BAA** - For healthcare organizations (additional setup required)
✅ **SSO Integration** - Enterprise authentication (roadmap)
✅ **Audit Logs** - User activity tracking (enterprise feature)

### **What We Don't Do:**
❌ **No Admin Access to Content** - Organizations cannot read user reflections
❌ **No Surveillance** - This is a personal development tool, not monitoring
❌ **No Performance Tracking** - Reflections are private, not evaluation tools

## Best Practices for Interpreters

### **Maintaining Confidentiality While Reflecting:**

**Instead of:**
> "I interpreted for John Smith's surgery at Memorial Hospital. Dr. Johnson was very demanding."

**Write:**
> "I interpreted for a surgical procedure at a hospital. The surgeon had high expectations and a fast pace."

**Instead of:**
> "The custody case between Maria Garcia and Tom Garcia was emotionally intense."

**Write:**
> "A family law proceeding was emotionally charged, with high conflict between parties."

**Instead of:**
> "Student Emma Jones struggled with the math test in Ms. Brown's class."

**Write:**
> "A student was having difficulty with an academic assessment, and the teacher was concerned."
