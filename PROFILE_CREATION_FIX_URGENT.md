# üö® URGENT: Profile Creation Fix

**Date:** October 26, 2025  
**Priority:** CRITICAL  
**Status:** Fix ready to deploy

---

## Problem

New users signing up are NOT getting entries created in the `profiles` table, which causes:
- Users can't access the app (subscription check fails)
- Users appear in Stripe but not in Supabase
- Authentication works but app features are blocked

---

## Root Cause

Your app uses **TWO profile tables**:

1. **`profiles`** (PRIMARY) - Contains:
   - `subscription_status`
   - `is_admin`
   - `trial_started_at` / `trial_ends_at`
   - `stripe_customer_id`
   - Used by: ProtectedRoute, subscription checks, admin features

2. **`user_profiles`** (SECONDARY) - Contains:
   - `full_name`
   - `accessibility_settings`
   - `pronouns`, `credentials`
   - Used by: Profile settings, personalization

**The `profiles` table was missing a trigger to create entries for new users!**

The `user_profiles_schema.sql` migration only created triggers for `user_profiles` and `user_preferences`, but NOT for the main `profiles` table that your app depends on.

---

## Solution

Run this SQL script immediately:

```bash
supabase/fix_profile_creation_CRITICAL.sql
```

### What it does:

1. ‚úÖ Ensures `profiles` table has all required columns
2. ‚úÖ Creates a comprehensive `handle_new_user()` function that populates BOTH tables
3. ‚úÖ Sets up proper RLS policies on `profiles` table
4. ‚úÖ Creates trigger on `auth.users` to auto-create profiles
5. ‚úÖ **Backfills missing profiles for existing users**
6. ‚úÖ Verifies the fix worked

---

## How to Deploy

### Option 1: Supabase Dashboard (Recommended)
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí SQL Editor
2. Copy contents of `supabase/fix_profile_creation_CRITICAL.sql`
3. Paste and click "Run"
4. Check the output for success messages

### Option 2: Command Line
```bash
psql -h <your-supabase-host> -U postgres -d postgres -f supabase/fix_profile_creation_CRITICAL.sql
```

---

## Verification

After running the script, you should see:

```
========================================
PROFILE CREATION FIX - SUMMARY
========================================
Total users: X
Users with profiles: X
Users with user_profiles: X
Users with preferences: X

‚úÖ ALL USERS HAVE PROFILES!

Trigger status: ACTIVE
New signups will automatically create profiles.
========================================
```

Then check recent users:
```sql
SELECT 
  u.id,
  u.email,
  u.created_at,
  CASE WHEN p.id IS NOT NULL THEN '‚úÖ' ELSE '‚ùå' END as has_profile,
  p.subscription_status
FROM auth.users u
LEFT JOIN public.profiles p ON u.id = p.id
ORDER BY u.created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

All users should have ‚úÖ in the `has_profile` column.

---

## Test New Signup

After deploying the fix:

1. Create a new test account
2. Check that the user appears in BOTH tables:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM profiles WHERE email = 'test@example.com';
   SELECT * FROM user_profiles WHERE email = 'test@example.com';
   ```
3. Verify the user can access the app without errors

---

## Why This Happened

The enterprise dashboard migrations (`create_enterprise_tables.sql`, `step2_create_organization_members_table.sql`) didn't cause this issue directly.

The real problem was that:
1. Your app was refactored to use a `profiles` table (not `user_profiles`)
2. The `user_profiles_schema.sql` migration only created triggers for `user_profiles`
3. No trigger was ever created for the main `profiles` table
4. This issue may have existed before the enterprise dashboard work

---

## Files Created

1. **`supabase/fix_profile_creation_CRITICAL.sql`** - The fix (RUN THIS NOW)
2. **`supabase/diagnose_profile_issue.sql`** - Diagnostic queries
3. **`PROFILE_CREATION_FIX_URGENT.md`** - This document

---

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Run `fix_profile_creation_CRITICAL.sql` immediately
2. ‚úÖ Verify all existing users now have profiles
3. ‚úÖ Test new signup flow
4. ‚úÖ Monitor for any errors in the next 24 hours
5. Consider consolidating to a single profile table in the future

---

## Impact

**Before Fix:**
- ‚ùå New users can't use the app
- ‚ùå Subscription checks fail
- ‚ùå Users stuck at login

**After Fix:**
- ‚úÖ New users automatically get profiles
- ‚úÖ Existing users backfilled
- ‚úÖ App works normally
- ‚úÖ 14-day trial starts automatically
