# Session Management Fix - Complete Guide

## Problem Solved
Users were seeing "no subscription" errors after being logged in for a while, even though they had active subscriptions. This was NOT a subscription issue - it was a **session expiration problem**.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Extended JWT Token Expiry (Local Development)
- **Changed:** JWT expiry from 1 hour to 24 hours in `supabase/config.toml`
- **Line 124:** `jwt_expiry = 86400  # 24 hours`

### 2. Added Subscription Data Reload on Token Refresh
- **File:** `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`
- **Change:** When the token is refreshed (`TOKEN_REFRESHED` event), the app now:
  - Reloads user profile data
  - Reloads subscription status
  - Triggers a data sync

This ensures subscription data stays current even after token refresh.

### 3. Created Session Expiration Modal
- **New Component:** `src/components/SessionExpiredModal.tsx`
- **Features:**
  - Clear message that session expired (NOT subscription)
  - Reassures user their subscription is still active
  - 10-second countdown before auto-redirect
  - "Sign In Now" button for immediate action

### 4. Added Session Expiration Detection
- **File:** `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`
- Detects when user is signed out due to expiration (vs manual logout)
- Triggers `sessionExpired` event for the UI to handle

### 5. Integrated Modal in App
- **File:** `src/App.tsx`
- Listens for `sessionExpired` events
- Shows SessionExpiredModal instead of subscription errors
- Properly handles redirect after modal

## IMPORTANT: Production Setup Required

### Update JWT Expiry in Supabase Dashboard

The local config change only affects local development. You MUST update this in your **Supabase Dashboard** for production:

#### Steps:
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/kvguxuxanpynwdffpssm/settings/auth
2. Find the **JWT Expiry** setting
3. Change from `3600` (1 hour) to `86400` (24 hours)
4. Click **Save**

#### Alternative Values:
- `3600` = 1 hour (old default)
- `86400` = 24 hours (recommended)
- `604800` = 7 days (maximum allowed)

## How It Works Now

### Before Fix:
1. User logs in ✅
2. After 1 hour, JWT token expires
3. Token auto-refreshes ✅
4. **BUT** subscription data doesn't reload ❌
5. User sees "No subscription" error ❌
6. User thinks subscription is broken ❌

### After Fix:
1. User logs in ✅
2. After 24 hours, JWT token expires (longer session)
3. Token auto-refreshes ✅
4. **Subscription data reloads automatically** ✅
5. If session truly expires (after 24 hours of inactivity):
   - **SessionExpiredModal appears** ✅
   - Clear message: "Your session expired, but your subscription is still active" ✅
   - User can sign in again easily ✅

## User Experience Improvements

### Old Experience (Bad):
```
User after 1 hour: "Why does it say I don't have a subscription?
                    I just paid! This is broken!"
```

### New Experience (Good):
```
User after 24 hours of inactivity:
[Clear Modal Appears]
"Session Expired
Your session has expired for security reasons.
Please sign in again to continue.

Note: Your subscription is still active. You just
need to sign in again to access your account.

[Sign In Now Button]"
```

## Testing

### Test Session Expiration:
1. Sign in to the app
2. Open browser DevTools → Console
3. Run: `window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('sessionExpired'))`
4. You should see the SessionExpiredModal appear

### Test Token Refresh:
1. Sign in to the app
2. Wait for token to refresh (check console for "Token refreshed successfully")
3. Go to Profile Settings
4. Subscription status should still show correctly

---

## Technical Details

### Files Modified:
1. `supabase/config.toml` - Extended JWT expiry
2. `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Added token refresh data reload + expiration detection
3. `src/components/SessionExpiredModal.tsx` - New modal component
4. `src/App.tsx` - Integrated modal and event listener

### Events Used:
- `TOKEN_REFRESHED` - Supabase auth event when token auto-refreshes
- `sessionExpired` - Custom event dispatched when session expires (not manual logout)

### Key Functions:
- `UserDataLoader.loadUserData()` - Reloads profile and subscription from database
- `dataSyncService.triggerManualSync()` - Syncs all user data

---

## Maintenance Notes

- Monitor session expiration complaints - should drop to near zero
- If users report logout issues, check Supabase Dashboard JWT settings
- The 24-hour session is a balance between security and UX
- Can be extended up to 7 days (604800 seconds) if needed

---

## Rollback (if needed)

If you need to revert these changes:

1. **Supabase Dashboard:** Change JWT expiry back to 3600
2. **Git:** `git revert <commit-hash>` for the code changes
3. Redeploy the app

However, these changes are **highly recommended** to keep - they significantly improve the user experience!
