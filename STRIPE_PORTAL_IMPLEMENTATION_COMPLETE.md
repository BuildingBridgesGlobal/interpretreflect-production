## 🚀 What Changed

### 2. Updated ManageSubscription Component
**File:** `src/components/ManageSubscription.tsx`

**Changes:**

- Now calls `create-portal-session` Edge Function
- Redirects user to Stripe Customer Portal
- Updated modal to explain where they're going

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Actually cancels in Stripe (not just database)
- ✅ Users can also update payment methods
- ✅ View full billing history
- ✅ Download invoices
- ✅ Legally compliant (FTC, GDPR, etc.)

---

### 3. Deployed to Production
**Command used:**
```bash
npx supabase functions deploy create-portal-session --no-verify-jwt --project-ref kvguxuxanpynwdffpssm
```

**Status:** ✅ DEPLOYED AND LIVE

## ⚙️ How It Works Technically

### The Flow:

```
1. User clicks "Cancel Subscription"
   ↓
2. Frontend calls create-portal-session Edge Function
   ↓
3. Edge Function:
   - Validates user authentication
   - Gets stripe_customer_id from profiles table
   - Calls Stripe API: stripe.billingPortal.sessions.create()
   - Returns portal URL
   ↓
4. Frontend redirects user to portal URL
   ↓
5. User manages subscription in Stripe
   ↓
6. Stripe webhook fires (customer.subscription.updated)
   ↓
7. Your stripe-webhook Edge Function:
   - Receives webhook
   - Updates subscriptions table
   - Updates profiles table
   ↓
8. User returns to your app
   ↓
9. App shows updated subscription status
```

## 🔍 Monitoring & Debugging

### Check if Portal Session Creation Works:

**Supabase Dashboard:**
https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/kvguxuxanpynwdffpssm/functions/create-portal-session

**Look for logs:**
```
✅ Creating portal session for user: abc-123-def
✅ Found Stripe customer: cus_ABC123
✅ Portal session created: bps_ABC123
```

**Errors to watch for:**
- ❌ "Missing authorization header" - User not authenticated
- ❌ "No Stripe customer ID found" - Profile missing stripe_customer_id
- ❌ Stripe API errors - Check Stripe dashboard

### Check if Webhooks Work:

**Supabase Dashboard:**
https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/kvguxuxanpynwdffpssm/functions/stripe-webhook

**Look for:**
```
✅ customer.subscription.updated received
✅ Subscription status updated to: canceled
✅ User retains access until: 2025-12-31
```

### Check in Stripe Dashboard:

https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/subscriptions

**Look for:**
- Subscription status: "Active" → "Cancels on Dec 31"
- Webhook events: customer.subscription.updated
- Webhook delivery: 200 OK

---

## 🎯 Success Metrics

After deploying, you should see:

✅ **Zero billing disputes** from users who cancelled
✅ **Zero chargebacks** for "charged after cancellation"
✅ **Higher trust** - users see professional Stripe interface
✅ **Support tickets drop** - self-service portal handles it all
✅ **Compliance** - FTC, GDPR automatically handled by Stripe

---

## 🚨 Important Notes

### DO NOT go back to the old system!

The old `cancel_subscription` RPC function is still in your database, but it's not being used anymore.

**Consider removing it to avoid confusion:**

```sql
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS cancel_subscription(UUID);
```

Or keep it but add a comment:

```sql
-- DEPRECATED: Do not use. Cancellation now handled via Stripe Customer Portal.
-- This function only updated local database, not Stripe.
```

### Stripe Customer Portal Configuration:

Make sure your Stripe Customer Portal is configured:

1. Go to: https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/portal
2. Enable features:
   - ✅ Cancel subscriptions
   - ✅ Update payment methods
   - ✅ View invoices
3. Set your branding:
   - Logo
   - Colors
   - Business name
4. Configure cancellation behavior:
   - ✅ Allow immediate cancellation
   - ✅ Retain access until period end
   - ✅ Collect cancellation reason (optional)
