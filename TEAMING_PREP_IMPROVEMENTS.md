# Teaming Prep - Proposed Improvements

## Current Issues

### **Too Many Questions (7 pages, ~25 fields)**
- Users may feel overwhelmed
- Some questions overlap or are too similar
- Too academic/formal in places

### **Specific Problems:**
1. "How do you typically prefer to work in interpreting teams? Describe your ideal team dynamic" - wordy
2. "What role do you naturally gravitate toward" - could be simpler
3. Missing concrete examples in most placeholders
4. No help text to guide newer interpreters
5. Some questions feel repetitive (communication style, feedback preferences, boundaries)

## Proposed New Structure (5 Pages)

### **Page 1: Getting Started**
- What excites you about this team assignment?
- What concerns you about working with a team?
- Virtual, in-person, or hybrid?

### **Page 2: Your Team Style**
- What's your ideal team dynamic?
- What role do you naturally take?
- Past team experience influencing you?

### **Page 3: Communication Plan** (COMBINED)
- How will you signal for handoffs?
- Virtual/in-person strategies (conditional)
- How do you like to give/receive feedback?
- What boundaries do you need?

### **Page 4: Challenges & Strengths**
- What challenges do you anticipate?
- What are your unique strengths?
- What support do you need?

### **Page 5: Success Vision**
- What does success look like?
- Your commitment to the team
- Confidence level

## Key Changes

### **1. Reduce from 7 to 5 pages**
- Combine overlapping sections
- Remove redundant questions
- Keep essential content

### **2. Simplify Language**
**Before:** "How do you typically prefer to work in interpreting teams? Describe your ideal team dynamic."
**After:** "What's your ideal team dynamic?"

**Before:** "What role do you naturally gravitate toward in team interpreting settings?"
**After:** "What role do you naturally take in teams?"

### **3. Add Concrete Examples**
Every question gets real-world examples:
- "Example: I work best when there's clear communication and mutual respect..."
- "Example: I tend to be the organizer who coordinates logistics..."

### **4. Add Help Text**
Brief guidance for each question:
- "Think about what makes you feel comfortable and effective"
- "This helps your team understand how to work with you"

### **5. Combine Similar Questions**
- Communication style + feedback preferences → one section
- Challenges + preparation → combined
- Success vision + commitments → combined
