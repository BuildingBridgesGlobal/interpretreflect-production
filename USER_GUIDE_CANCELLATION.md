# How Users Cancel Their Subscription

## Current User Flow (What They See)

### Step 1: Navigate to Subscription Management
1. User logs into InterpretReflect
2. Goes to **Profile Settings** (click their profile icon/avatar)
3. Clicks **"Manage Subscription"** button

### Step 2: View Current Subscription
User sees a page showing:
- Current plan (Essential/Professional/etc.)
- Monthly price
- Next billing date
- Payment method (card ending in XXXX)
- Subscription status (Active/Trial/etc.)

### Step 3: Click Cancel Button
- In the "Actions" section, there's a **"Cancel Subscription"** button
- Has a red X icon
- Says "Cancel anytime" underneath

### Step 4: Confirm Cancellation
A modal pops up asking:
> "Are you sure you want to cancel? You will retain access until [date]."

Two buttons:
- **"Keep Subscription"** (gray) - Goes back
- **"Yes, Cancel"** (red) - Confirms cancellation

### Step 5: See Success Message
After confirming:
- ✅ Success toast: "Subscription cancelled successfully"
- Page updates to show cancelled status
- Access continues until end of billing period

## 🚨 CRITICAL PROBLEM

**The "Cancel Subscription" button in the app does NOT actually cancel in Stripe!**

**What happens:**
1. ❌ App updates local database only
2. ❌ Stripe is NOT notified
3. ❌ User KEEPS GETTING BILLED
4. ❌ User thinks they cancelled but didn't

**Result:** Billing disputes, angry customers, chargebacks 😱

---

## ✅ HOW USERS SHOULD ACTUALLY CANCEL (For Now)

### Option 1: Email Support (Safest)
**Email:** info@interpretreflect.com

**Email Template:**
```
Subject: Cancel My Subscription

Hi InterpretReflect Team,

I would like to cancel my subscription.

Account email: [your email]
Reason (optional): [reason]

Thank you!
```

**What happens:**
- Support manually cancels in Stripe
- Stripe webhook updates database
- User gets confirmation email
- No billing issues ✅

---

### Option 2: Stripe Customer Portal (Direct)

If you set up the Stripe Customer Portal, users can:

1. Go to Manage Subscription page
2. Click "Manage Billing" button
3. Get redirected to Stripe
4. Cancel there directly
5. Stripe updates your database automatically

**This is the ideal solution!**

---

## 📅 What Happens After Cancellation

### Immediate:
- ✅ Subscription marked as "Cancelled"
- ✅ No future charges scheduled
- ✅ User retains access until period end

### Until End of Billing Period:
- ✅ User can still use all features
- ✅ Data remains accessible
- ✅ Can export all reflections

### After Billing Period Ends:
- Account converts to "Free" tier
- Premium features locked
- Data remains saved (can reactivate anytime)
- Can still export data

## 🔄 Can Users Reactivate?

**Yes!** Users can reactivate anytime by:

1. Going to Manage Subscription
2. Clicking "Upgrade Plan"
3. Selecting their desired plan
4. Entering payment info
5. Instant access restored ✅

**All their data is preserved!**

## 💳 Billing After Cancellation

### What Gets Charged:
- ✅ Current billing period (already paid)
- ❌ NO future charges

### What Doesn't Get Charged:
- ❌ Cancellation fees (there are none!)
- ❌ Early termination fees (there are none!)
- ❌ Pro-rated refunds (not offered)

### Example:
```
Subscription started: Dec 1, 2025
User cancels: Dec 15, 2025
Billing period ends: Jan 1, 2026

✅ User keeps access until Jan 1
✅ Paid $12 for Dec 1 - Jan 1 (keeps it)
❌ No charge on Jan 1 (cancelled)
```

## ⚠️ TEMPORARY NOTICE FOR USERS

**Until the cancellation system is updated:**

> To ensure your subscription is properly cancelled and you are not charged again, please email info@interpretreflect.com to cancel rather than using the in-app button.
>
> We're currently upgrading our cancellation system to Stripe's Customer Portal for an even better experience!

**This protects users from the current bug.**
