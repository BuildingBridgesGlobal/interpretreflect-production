ECCI Framework Landing Page Refresh
====================================

Strategic Rationale
-------------------
- Keep the ECCI Framework visible as the proprietary differentiator and IP moat.
- Lead with academic legitimacy to reinforce credibility competitors cannot mimic.
- Reposition the copy so the science feels accessible to overwhelmed interpreters.

Priority Quick Wins
-------------------
- Update the hero subheadline to plain-language benefits.
- Swap the hero badge text to "Trusted by Interpreters Nationwide".
- Standardize every primary CTA button to "Start Your Performance Assessment".
- Replace the outdated "Active December 1, 2025" reference with "Now Active".
- Add the 2024-2025 timing to the data-driven stats intro.
