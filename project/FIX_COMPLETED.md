# âœ… Fix Completed - Site Working Again!

## ðŸ”§ What Was Wrong

When we cleaned up old component versions earlier, we deleted:

- `MentoringPrepV2.tsx`
- `PostAssignmentDebriefV3.tsx`
- `TeamingReflectionV2.tsx`

But App.tsx was still trying to import and use them!

## âœ… How We Fixed It

1. **Removed broken imports**
   - Deleted: `import { MentoringPrepV2 }`

2. **Replaced with working components**
   - `PostAssignmentDebriefV3` â†’ `PostAssignmentDebriefEnhanced`
   - `TeamingReflectionV2` â†’ `TeamingReflectionEnhanced`
   - `MentoringPrepV2` â†’ `MentoringPrepAccessible`

3. **Added missing import**
   - Added: `import { TeamingReflectionEnhanced }`

## ðŸŽ¯ Current Status

âœ… **Site is working again!**

- No import errors
- All components loading
- Dev server running on port 5174
- Ready to continue refactoring

## ðŸ’¡ Lesson Learned

When deleting old files, always:

1. Search for imports first
2. Replace component usage
3. Test before moving on

The good news: TypeScript and Vite caught the error immediately, so nothing was actually broken in production!
