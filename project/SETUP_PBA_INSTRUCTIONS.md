# Setting Up the Predictive Burnout Algorithm (PBA)

## Quick Setup (2 minutes)

### Step 1: Run the SQL Function in Supabase

1. Go to your [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
2. Select your project
3. Navigate to **SQL Editor** (left sidebar)
4. Click **New Query**
5. Copy and paste the entire contents of `CREATE_PBA_FUNCTION.sql`
6. Click **Run** (or press Ctrl+Enter)

You should see: "Success. No rows returned"

### Step 2: Verify Installation

Run this test query in the SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Test with a sample user ID (replace with an actual user ID from your auth.users table)
SELECT predict_burnout_risk(
  (SELECT id FROM auth.users LIMIT 1)
);
```

You should see a JSON result with risk assessment data.

## What the PBA Does

The Predictive Burnout Algorithm analyzes your reflection patterns to:

1. **Calculate Risk Score (0-10)**
   - Based on energy levels, stress patterns, and engagement
   - Updated in real-time with each reflection

2. **Predict Burnout Timeline**
   - Estimates weeks until potential burnout
   - Based on trend analysis (improving/stable/worsening)

3. **Generate Interventions**
   - Immediate actions for critical risk (8-10)
   - Urgent support for high risk (6-8)
   - Preventive measures for moderate risk (4-6)
   - Maintenance for low risk (0-4)

4. **Track Key Factors**
   - Energy trends and stability
   - Stress frequency and peaks
   - Engagement patterns
   - Recovery needs

## How It Works

The algorithm analyzes your last 14 days of reflections:

```
Risk Score =
  25% Energy Level (lower = higher risk)
  + 15% Energy Stability (variance = risk)
  + 15% Low Energy Days (frequency)
  + 15% Average Stress Level
  + 10% High Stress Days
  + 10% Current Burnout Score
  + 10% Engagement Variety
```

## Where to See It

1. Go to the **Growth Insights** tab
2. Look for the **Burnout Risk Monitor** section
3. You'll see:
   - Current risk level (colored indicator)
   - Risk trend (improving/stable/worsening)
   - Weeks until burnout (if at risk)
   - Recommended interventions
   - Real-time alerts for critical risk

## Testing the PBA

To see it in action:

1. Complete several reflections over a few days
2. Vary your stress/energy levels in the reflections
3. The PBA will start making predictions after 2+ reflections
4. Accuracy improves with 7+ reflections (90% confidence)

## Troubleshooting

If the PBA isn't working:

1. **Check if function exists:**

```sql
SELECT proname FROM pg_proc WHERE proname = 'predict_burnout_risk';
```

2. **Check permissions:**

```sql
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION predict_burnout_risk(uuid) TO authenticated;
```

3. **Check for data:**

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM reflection_entries
WHERE user_id = (SELECT id FROM auth.users LIMIT 1)
AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '14 days';
```

4. **Manual test in browser console:**

```javascript
const testPBA = async () => {
  const { burnoutPredictionService } = await import('./src/services/burnoutPredictionService');
  const { supabase } = await import('./src/lib/supabase');

  const {
    data: { user },
  } = await supabase.auth.getUser();
  if (!user) {
    console.error('Not logged in!');
    return;
  }

  const result = await burnoutPredictionService.predictBurnoutRisk(user.id);
  console.log('PBA Result:', result);
};

testPBA();
```

## Privacy & Security

- The PBA can work in two modes:
  1. **Direct mode**: Uses your user ID (faster, for personal use)
  2. **ZKWV mode**: Uses hashed ID (anonymous, for enterprise)

- All calculations happen in the database
- No personal data leaves the system
- Results are never shared without consent

## Next Steps

1. Complete daily reflections to improve accuracy
2. Watch for trend changes in the monitor
3. Follow intervention recommendations
4. The system learns and improves over time
