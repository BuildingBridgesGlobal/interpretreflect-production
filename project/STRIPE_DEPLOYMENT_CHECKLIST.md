# Or manually run the SQL in: supabase/migrations/create_payment_tables.sql
```

### 2. Deploy Stripe Secrets to Supabase 🔐

```bash
# Deploy your live keys (replace with your actual key from Stripe Dashboard)
supabase secrets set STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_YOUR_STRIPE_SECRET_KEY

# After setting up webhook, add the signing secret
supabase secrets set STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_YOUR_WEBHOOK_SECRET
```

### 3. Deploy Edge Functions 🚀

```bash
# Deploy all payment-related functions
supabase functions deploy create-checkout-session
supabase functions deploy create-portal-session
supabase functions deploy handle-webhook
```

### 4. Configure Stripe Webhook 🔔

1. Go to: https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks
2. Click "Add endpoint"
3. **Endpoint URL**: `https://kvguxuxanpynwdffpssm.supabase.co/functions/v1/handle-webhook`
4. **Select events**:

5. Copy the **Signing secret** (starts with `whsec_`)
6. Deploy it: `supabase secrets set STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_YOUR_SECRET`

### 5. Update Your App Routes 🛣️

Add these routes to your `App.tsx`:

```jsx
import { PricingProduction } from './pages/PricingProduction';
import { PaymentSuccess } from './pages/PaymentSuccess';
import { AdminDashboard } from './pages/AdminDashboard';

// In your routes:
<Route path="/pricing" element={<PricingProduction />} />
<Route path="/payment-success" element={<PaymentSuccess />} />
<Route path="/admin" element={<AdminDashboard />} />
```

### 6. Add Payment Button to Landing Page 💳

In your main landing page or wherever you want the upgrade button:

```jsx
import { StripePaymentButton } from './components/StripePaymentButton';

// Add the button
<StripePaymentButton buttonText="Upgrade to Premium" useDirectLink={true} />;
```
