# Technique Usage Tracking Setup

## ‚úÖ What Was Done

### 1. Created Database Table

- **File**: `CREATE_TECHNIQUE_USAGE_TABLE.sql`
- **Run this in Supabase SQL Editor** to create the `technique_usage` table

### 2. Connected to Real Data

The "Most Effective" technique in your Toolkit Insights now shows:

- **Your actual most used technique** (not hardcoded "Box Breathing")
- **Real completion rates** from your usage
- **Actual stress relief scores** (if you rate before/after)
- **Personalized "Try Next" suggestions** based on what you haven't used

### 3. How Data Flows Now

#### When You Start a Technique:

1. Click any stress reset tool (Breathing, Body Check-In, etc.)
2. Automatically saves to `technique_usage` table with:
   - Technique name
   - Start time
   - Your user ID

#### When You Complete/Close a Technique:

1. Updates the record with:
   - Completion status
   - Duration
   - Stress levels (if provided)

#### In Toolkit Insights:

- **Most Effective**: Shows technique with highest average stress relief
- **Completion Rate**: Real percentage of techniques you complete vs start
- **Avg Stress Relief**: Calculated from your before/after ratings
- **Try Next**: Suggests least-used technique
- **Weekly Usage**: Count of techniques used in last 7 days

## üìù To Complete Setup

1. **Run the SQL**:
   - Go to Supabase Dashboard
   - Open SQL Editor
   - Copy contents of `CREATE_TECHNIQUE_USAGE_TABLE.sql`
   - Run it

2. **Test It**:
   - Use any stress reset tool
   - Complete it or close it
   - Check Growth Insights tab
   - "Most Effective" should show your actual usage!

## üîÑ Data Persistence

- ‚úÖ **Saves to Supabase** when logged in
- ‚úÖ **Falls back to localStorage** when offline
- ‚úÖ **Syncs on login** - your stats persist across sessions
- ‚úÖ **Works across devices** - same account shows same stats

## üìä What You'll See

Instead of fake data like:

- Most Effective: "Box Breathing" (hardcoded)
- Completion Rate: 75% (fake)

You'll see YOUR real data:

- Most Effective: "Body Check-In" (if that's what works best for you)
- Completion Rate: 92% (your actual completion rate)
- Avg Stress Relief: 2.3 points (your actual average)

The more you use the tools, the more accurate your insights become!
