# Privacy Policy

**Version: 3.0.0**
**Effective Date: January 22, 2025**
**Last Updated: January 23, 2025**

InterpretReflect ("InterpretReflect," "we," "our," "us") provides a digital wellness and professional development platform for interpreters (the "Service"). This Privacy Policy explains what we collect, why, how we use and share it, and the choices you have.

If you do not agree with this policy, please do not use the Service.

## 1) Who we are & scope

**Controller/Business**: InterpretReflect operated by Huvia Technologies, LLC (contact in Section 16).

**Scope**: This Policy applies to the website, web/app products, support channels, and any integrations we operate.

**Not healthcare**: We are not a HIPAA Covered Entity and do not provide medical care. We may operate as a HIPAA Business Associate only if we execute a BAA for a specific integration (see Section 13.2).

## 2) What we collect

We practice data minimization—collect only what's needed to run the Service.

### 2.1 Account & contact data
Name, email, password (hashed), locale, time zone, subscription tier, billing status.

### 2.2 Product usage metadata (not content)
Feature usage, page views, coarse timestamps, device/app version, IP address, OS/browser data, performance/error logs, referrers.

We do not collect your reflection/journal content as metadata.

### 2.3 Content you provide (encrypted at rest)
Reflections, notes, journaling entries, uploaded files you attach within the Service.

**Default**: we cannot read this content without your explicit, in-app consent (temporary support access). See Section 8.3.

### 2.4 Wellness inputs (user-entered)
Self-reflection prompts, mood/energy tags, non-clinical check-ins you voluntarily enter.

We do not collect clinical diagnoses or treatment plans and do not ask for them.

### 2.5 Community/peer features (if enabled)
Posts, comments, messages, profile handles, and any content you choose to share publicly or with other users.

### 2.6 Payments
Handled by third-party processors (e.g., Stripe). We receive limited payment metadata (success/failure, last 4 of card, expiration month/year) but not full card numbers.

### 2.7 Cookies & similar tech
Strictly necessary cookies (login/session), functional (preferences), analytics/performance, and (if ever used) advertising/retargeting (off by default). See Section 9.

### 2.8 From partners/integrations (optional)
If you connect third-party tools, we process the minimum required tokens/IDs and scoped data to provide the integration, as authorized by you.

## 3) Why we process data (purposes) & legal bases

### 3.1 Purposes
- Provide, secure, and improve the Service
- Account creation, authentication, and billing
- Customer support (with user-authorized content access only)
- Debugging, incident response, and abuse prevention
- Product analytics (aggregate/de-identified where possible)
- Legal compliance, enforcement of Terms
- Communicating service updates and changes (transactional); optional marketing with opt-out

### 3.2 GDPR legal bases (where applicable)
- **Contract** (Art. 6(1)(b)) – providing the Service you requested
- **Legitimate interests** (Art. 6(1)(f)) – security, fraud prevention, analytics (balanced with your rights)
- **Consent** (Art. 6(1)(a)) – where required (e.g., non-essential cookies, marketing, optional integrations)
- **Legal obligation** (Art. 6(1)(c)) – complying with law and lawful requests

### 3.3 Special categories
We design the Service not to process clinical/diagnostic health data. If you voluntarily enter sensitive information, we treat it as confidential and apply heightened protections. We do not use such content for advertising or sell/share it.

## 4) AI transparency

**AI involvement**: Some features use AI to generate reflections or suggestions.

**No professional advice**: AI is not a clinician; outputs may be wrong or inappropriate.

**Training**: Your personal content is not used to train AI models. We use public/licensed datasets and/or vendor foundation models.

**Evaluation & safety**: We may use aggregated, de-identified telemetry to evaluate feature safety/performance.

**Human review**: We do not live-monitor your conversations. We may review aggregated data or specific content only with your explicit consent or where required by law or urgent safety obligations.

## 5) "We don't sell your data" (and "share" under CCPA/CPRA)

- We do not sell personal information.
- We do not share personal information for cross-context behavioral advertising (as defined by CPRA).
- If this ever changes, we will provide required Do Not Sell/Share controls and obtain any required consent.

## 6) How we disclose information

We disclose data only as needed, with safeguards:

- **Processors/Service Providers**: hosting (infra), analytics (aggregate), email delivery, customer support tooling, payments, security scanning, error logging. Bound by contracts; no secondary use.
- **Community features (if enabled)**: content you choose to make public or share with other users is visible accordingly.
- **Legal**: to comply with valid legal processes or protect rights/safety.
- **Corporate events**: merger, acquisition, or asset sale—subject to this Policy and notice.
- **Aggregated/De-identified**: we may share insights that cannot reasonably identify you.

We do not disclose your encrypted content to support or vendors unless you grant temporary access via in-app consent.

## 7) Data retention

- **Account data**: retained while your account is active.
- **Encrypted content**: deleted within 30 days of account deletion request.
- **Backups**: purged within 90 days.
- **Legal holds**: retained only as required by law.
- We keep the minimum necessary for tax/audit/compliance.

## 8) Your controls & choices

### 8.1 Access, correction, deletion, portability
- You can access/update profile data in-app.
- Request a copy or deletion of your personal data at info@interpretreflect.com.
- We will verify your identity and respond within statutory timelines.

### 8.2 Opt-outs
- **Marketing emails**: unsubscribe link or in-app settings.
- **Non-essential cookies/analytics**: see Cookie Controls (Section 9).
- **AI features**: opt-out for certain AI-enabled functions where feasible (may limit functionality).

### 8.3 Support access to your content (your call)
- By default, we cannot see your reflections/content.
- If you need help with content-specific issues, you can grant time-limited access via in-app consent. You can revoke at any time.

## 9) Cookies & similar technologies

- **Strictly necessary (required)**: auth/session, security, load balancing.
- **Functional**: preferences, localization.
- **Analytics**: usage and performance (aggregate).
- **Advertising**: off by default; not used for cross-context behavioral ads.

**Controls**:
- Cookie banner/settings where required (EU/UK et al.).
- Global Privacy Control (GPC) honored where applicable.
- Browser-level controls may affect functionality.

## 10) Security

We use technical and organizational measures aligned with industry standards:

- **Encryption in transit**: TLS 1.3
- **Encryption at rest**: AES-256-GCM (additional layers for sensitive content)
- **Access controls**: MFA, RBAC, least privilege, audit logging
- **Key management**: segregation by data type; quarterly rotation
- **Testing**: quarterly penetration tests; automated vulnerability scanning
- **Compliance**: SOC 2 Type II in progress (target Q3 2025)

No system is 100% secure; we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## 11) Children & age restrictions

- The Service is for adults 18+ only.
- We do not knowingly collect data from children under 13 (COPPA).
- If we learn a minor has used the Service, we will suspend and delete data swiftly (see Terms).

## 12) International data transfers

- We may process data in the U.S. and other countries.
- Where required, we use Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) and/or the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (if certified) and apply supplementary safeguards.
- You may contact us for a copy of relevant transfer mechanisms (with redactions).

## 13) Regulatory notices

### 13.1 FTC Health Breach Notification Rule (HBNR)
As a Personal Health Record (PHR) vendor, we notify affected users within 60 days of discovering a breach of unsecured PHR identifiable health information and notify the FTC (and media for ≥500 residents in a state/territory), consistent with HBNR.

### 13.2 HIPAA
We are not a HIPAA Covered Entity. We act as a Business Associate only if a BAA is executed for a specific integration, and then only for that PHI.

### 13.3 EU/UK AI & other AI frameworks
We classify our AI as general-purpose/limited-risk. We implement transparency, risk management, oversight, and documentation consistent with evolving regulations (see Terms §25.1). This Privacy Policy governs data used in AI features.

## 14) Your rights by region

### 14.1 EEA/UK (GDPR/UK GDPR)
- Rights to access, rectification, erasure, restriction, portability, and objection.
- Right to withdraw consent where processing is based on consent.
- Right to lodge a complaint with your supervisory authority (e.g., ICO in the UK or your local DPA).

### 14.2 U.S. State Privacy (e.g., CA/VA/CO/CT/UT)
- Rights to know/access, delete, correct, portability, and limit use of sensitive data where applicable.
- We do not sell or share personal information for cross-context behavioral advertising.
- California residents may use an agent; we honor GPC signals where applicable.
- To exercise rights: info@interpretreflect.com.

## 15) Changes to this Policy

When we make material changes, we will notify you (email and/or in-app) and update the "Last Updated" date. Your continued use after the effective date means you accept the changes.

## 16) Contact us (and DPO, if applicable)

**Huvia Technologies, LLC**
Email: info@interpretreflect.com

EU/UK inquiries: If we appoint an EU/UK representative or DPO, we will publish their details here.

## 17) Additional disclosures

### 17.1 Analytics
We use privacy-respecting analytics focused on aggregate trends. Where regional law treats analytics as non-essential, we seek consent.

### 17.2 Community guidelines (if enabled)
Community features are optional and may be moderated for abuse/spam. Do not disclose client-identifying information. Community content may be retained as part of forum history even if you close your account, but we will pseudonymize it upon request where feasible and lawful.

### 17.3 Automated decision-making
We do not make legally significant decisions based solely on automated processing. If this changes, we will provide notices and options as required by law.

### 17.4 Third-party links
Linked resources are governed by their own privacy policies.

### 17.5 Data Processing Addendum (B2B)
If you are an organizational customer needing a DPA (including SCCs), contact info@interpretreflect.com.
